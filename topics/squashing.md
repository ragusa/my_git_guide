# Git Squashing

## 1. What is Squashing?
Squashing combines multiple commits into a single commit, typically to clean up the commit history before merging to the main branch.

## 2. Start an Interactive Rebase
To squash commits, start an interactive rebase on the branch you want to clean up:
```bash
git rebase -i <commit-hash>
```

**Explanation:** Replace `<commit-hash>` with the hash of the commit before the first commit you want to squash.

## 3. Mark Commits for Squashing
In the text editor that opens, change `pick` to `squash` (or `s`) for the commits you want to squash into the previous one:

```plaintext
pick abc123 First commit
squash def456 Second commit
squash ghi789 Third commit
```

**Explanation:** The `squash` command combines the commit with the one before it.

## 4. Edit Commit Message
Git will prompt you to edit the commit message for the squashed commits. Combine or rewrite the commit messages as appropriate.

## 5. Complete the Rebase
Once youâ€™ve made your changes, save and close the editor. Git will apply the changes and complete the rebase. If conflicts arise, resolve them as usual and continue the rebase with:
```bash
git rebase --continue
```

## 6. Push the Squashed Changes
If you've already pushed the commits, you'll need to force-push the squashed commits to update the branch:
```bash
git push --force-with-lease
```

**Explanation:** This ensures that no one else has made changes to the branch while you were squashing commits.
